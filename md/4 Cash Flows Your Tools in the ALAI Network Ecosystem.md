# 4 Cash Flows: Your Tools in the ALAI Network Ecosystem

The ALAI Network provides multiple avenues for generating cash flows, allowing participants to maximize their investments. Here’s a breakdown of the primary tools available in the ecosystem:

## 1. Token Price Growth: Why It Matters

One of the most significant aspects of the ALAI Network is the potential for token price appreciation. As the ecosystem develops, demand for the $ALAI token is expected to rise, particularly with upcoming events such as the DEX listing. Increased adoption and usage of the network will contribute to the upward pressure on the token's price. This growth creates an opportunity for early investors to benefit from capital appreciation, making it an attractive investment.

## 2. Dividend System

The ALAI Network features a robust dividend system that rewards token holders. Investors who hold $ALAI receive monthly dividends based on the overall profits generated by the network's unique AI trading system, which has consistently paid out for five months. This system provides passive income in USDT, allowing investors to benefit from the success of the network without needing to trade actively. Regular and reliable dividend payouts make investing in $ALAI highly appealing for those seeking a steady income stream while participating in the ALAI network's growth.

## 3. Staking in Four Tiers

Staking is a fundamental component of the ALAI Network, allowing participants to earn additional passive income. The staking system is divided into four tiers, each with different requirements and benefits:

- **Tier 1:**  
  Min $ALAI Needed: 100  
  Passive Income: 2.5%  
  Staking Period: 1 month  

- **Tier 2:**  
  Min $ALAI Needed: 1,000  
  Passive Income: 10%  
  Staking Period: 3 months  

- **Tier 3:**  
  Min $ALAI Needed: 10,000  
  Passive Income: 27%  
  Staking Period: 6 months  

- **Tier 4:**  
  Min $ALAI Needed: 100,000  
  Passive Income: 65.4%  
  Staking Period: 12 months  

Each tier offers increasing rewards, providing an incentive for investors to hold more $ALAI tokens and participate in the ecosystem for longer periods.

## 4. Referral System Linked to Tiers

The ALAI Network also features a referral system that rewards participants for bringing new investors into the ecosystem. The referral commissions are structured in tiers, encouraging users to increase their investments to unlock higher percentages:

- **Default:** 5% — starting level for all participants.  
- **Tier 1:** 8% — for holding 100 $ALAI.  
- **Tier 2:** 11% — for holding 1,000 $ALAI.  
- **Tier 3:** 14% — for holding 10,000 $ALAI.  
- **Tier 4:** 17.5% — for holding 100,000 $ALAI.

This referral system not only incentivizes existing members to engage with new participants but also aligns the interests of the community, fostering growth and sustainability within the ALAI Network.
