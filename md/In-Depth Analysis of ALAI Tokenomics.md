The ALAI tokenomics framework is more than just a distribution chart; it’s a strategic tool designed to ensure stability, growth, and trust. Every allocation has been carefully considered to balance the project’s needs with long-term objectives and market dynamics.

## Public Presale (55% = 11,550,000 $ALAI)
The public presale is the foundation for liquidity and trust-building within the project.

- **Creating a stable liquidity pool**: These tokens are dedicated to establishing a trading pool, ensuring ALAI Network’s confident market launch.

- **Early investor advantage**: Participation in the presale allows early supporters to acquire tokens at a lower price, enhancing the appeal of our offering and encouraging early adoption.

- **Introduction to the dividend system**: Early participants can start earning dividends immediately, showcasing the functionality and attractiveness of the ecosystem from day one.

Allocating over half of the tokens to this category highlights our commitment to stability and trust within the ecosystem.

## Team Tokens (10% = 2,100,000 $ALAI)
### Why a 3-year lock-up period for team tokens?
The lock-up period is a critical safeguard for investor confidence and team motivation.

- **Long-term Commitment**: A 3-year lock-up ensures that the team remains focused on the project’s success rather than short-term gains.

- **Market Stability**: This mechanism prevents sudden token sales that could destabilize the market.

- **Investor Assurance**: Locking team tokens signals that the project prioritizes community trust and sustainable growth over immediate benefits for the core team.

## Development (20% = 4,200,000 $ALAI)
### Why allocate 20% for development?
This allocation ensures continuous technological advancement and product innovation.

- **Driving Innovation**: Operating in a competitive space like AI and blockchain demands regular upgrades and the implementation of cutting-edge technologies.

- **Scaling the Ecosystem**: These funds will support the growth of ecosystem products and handle the increasing demand from a growing user base.

- **Ecosystem Support**: Development tokens may also facilitate integrations with partners and incentivize external contributors to enhance the ecosystem.

## Marketing (5% = 1,050,000 $ALAI)
### Why allocate 5% for marketing?
Marketing is a strategic investment to boost visibility and attract users.

- **Targeted Campaigns**: A 5% allocation enables impactful campaigns without overspending, focusing on high-yield markets and audiences.

- **Driving Awareness**: This ensures effective promotion of the ALAI brand, products, and benefits to expand the user base.

## Centralized Exchange (CEX) Liquidity (10% = 2,100,000 $ALAI)
### Why reserve 10% for liquidity on centralized exchanges?
CEX liquidity is crucial for accessibility and market expansion.

- **Ensuring Liquidity**: A 10% allocation provides sufficient liquidity to support stable trading conditions and minimize price volatility.

- **Optimal Launch**: This amount strikes the perfect balance—enough to ensure market activity without oversaturating the market.

- **Expanding Reach**: By ensuring robust liquidity on CEX platforms, ALAI tokens become more accessible to a wider audience, fostering ecosystem growth.

## Conclusion: A Balanced Approach with Long-Term Vision
Every decision in ALAI’s tokenomics has been made with purpose and precision:

- **For Investors**: The majority of tokens are allocated for public participation, ensuring transparency and trust.

- **For the Team**: A locked allocation emphasizes the team’s dedication to long-term goals.

- **For the Ecosystem**: Funds for development and marketing ensure scalability and sustained growth.
