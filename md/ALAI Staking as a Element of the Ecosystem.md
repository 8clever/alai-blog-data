ALAI staking is a forward-looking product that already provides a stable income today. Why do we say it’s about the future? Many major players in the market offer floating staking rates, which tend to decrease over time. With ALAI, the rates are fixed, ensuring guaranteed returns regardless of market conditions.
This stability is achieved through the use of artificial intelligence. AI algorithms, tested within ALAI’s core system, consistently deliver reliable results. While staking profitability is slightly lower compared to the dividend system, it remains a dependable and rewarding tool within the ALAI ecosystem.

## Why Is Staking Important for the Ecosystem?

The upcoming launch on CEX will serve as an additional incentive for users to join the ALAI dividend system, no matter the token price. This allows investors to access the best staking rates in the market, strengthening the project's position and enhancing token value.

Moreover, ALAI staking acts as a safe storage mechanism for USDT. Investors can earn rewards on their holdings without participating in the dividend system. This creates flexibility for investors within the ecosystem and adds another layer of value to ALAI Network.

## How to Maximize Your Staking Benefits?

The best approach is to combine staking with the dividend system. Your staking rates directly depend on your ALAI tier.
