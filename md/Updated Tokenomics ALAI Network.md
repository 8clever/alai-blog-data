# Updated Tokenomics: ALAI Network

We’re excited to unveil the updated tokenomics for ALAI Network, reflecting our commitment to fostering a decentralized and robust ecosystem. By revising the distribution of ALAI tokens, we aim to prioritize inclusivity, sustainability, and transparency, ensuring long-term growth for the network.

## New Token Distribution Breakdown

After a thorough review, here’s how the **21,000,000 ALAI tokens** will be allocated:

- **Public Presale**: 55% = 11,550,000 ALAI  
  *(Previously 40%)*  
- **Team**: 10% = 2,100,000 ALAI  
- **Development**: 20% = 4,200,000 ALAI  
- **Marketing**: 5% = 1,050,000 ALAI  
- **CEX Reserves**: 10% = 2,100,000 ALAI  

## Why We Increased the Public Presale Allocation

The decision to allocate **55% of tokens to the public presale** instead of the originally planned 40% is driven by a key goal: to ensure broader distribution among participants in the ALAI Network. Here’s why this matters:

### Decentralization and Stability

By giving a larger share of tokens to the public, we’re creating a more decentralized network. With more participants holding ALAI tokens, the system becomes inherently more secure and resilient against market volatility and centralized influence.

### Empowering the Community

We believe the true strength of any blockchain project lies in its community. This decision ensures that a majority of tokens remain in the hands of users, reinforcing their role as the primary stakeholders and decision-makers in the ALAI ecosystem.

### Increased Accessibility

A larger presale allocation means more participants can join the ALAI journey early, benefiting from lower entry prices and contributing to the ecosystem’s growth.

## Other Allocation Highlights

- **Team (10%)**  
  This allocation ensures the core team has the resources and motivation to continue developing the ALAI Network. Importantly, it remains a small percentage to maintain trust and minimize centralization.

- **Development (20%)**  
  Funds reserved for ongoing advancements, including the development of AI trading systems, platform updates, and new features that enhance user experience.

- **Marketing (5%)**  
  A targeted allocation to ensure ALAI Network reaches a wider audience through strategic campaigns, partnerships, and community engagement.

- **CEX Reserves (10%)**  
  Allocated to support liquidity and trading activity post-listing, ensuring smooth operations on centralized exchanges.

## Why the New Tokenomics Matter

This revised structure embodies our vision for a community-first ecosystem. By prioritizing public participation and token distribution, we’re laying a strong foundation for ALAI Network.
