## Why Update the Presale Structure?
We’re enhancing the presale process to:
- Provide the community with a precise end date for the initial sales period for greater transparency.
- Create a sense of urgency aligned with our deflationary model. Each presale phase will now close strictly after 7 days, even if the tokens for that phase sell out earlier.

## New Structure of the ALAI Network Presale

- **Start Date:** November 25, 2024.

- **Estimated Update Time:** 12:00 UTC.

- **Duration of Each Phase:** 7 days.

- **Price Increase:** 10% after each phase concludes.

- **Total Phases:** 10 presale stages.

- **Transition to CEX:** After the 10th phase, a 30-day countdown will begin, leading up to the official launch on centralized exchanges.
