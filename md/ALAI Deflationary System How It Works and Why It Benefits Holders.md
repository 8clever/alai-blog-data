**ALAI Network** has developed a thoughtful deflationary system designed to support stability and reward long-term token holders. This article outlines the main features of this system, including a capped token supply, incentives for holding, a deflationary presale model, and a multi-tiered referral system.

## Limited Supply: Fixed Cap of 21 Million Tokens

ALAI has a total fixed supply of 21 million tokens, making it a scarce digital asset. This limitation aligns ALAI with other leading assets in the crypto market with limited supply, driving demand and supporting the token's value over time.

## Holding Incentives: Monthly Dividends for Token Holders

A primary advantage for ALAI holders is the ability to earn monthly dividends. ALAI Network’s trading system generates profits, a portion of which is distributed to token holders as dividends in USDT. This setup creates a steady passive income for holders, allowing them to benefit without selling their tokens. Thus, the dividend system reduces selling pressure and fosters token stability by encouraging participants to hold onto their ALAI.

## Deflationary Model During Presale

ALAI Network also employs a deflationary model in its presale phase. Each successive presale stage raises the token price by $0.01, providing an extra incentive for early participation. This gradual price increase helps sustain investor interest and increases demand, steadily raising the token’s value.

## Multi-Tiered Referral System

ALAI Network’s referral program rewards participants based on the number of ALAI tokens they hold. The more tokens they hold, the higher their referral rewards. This structure encourages holders to accumulate more ALAI to access greater rewards, while also broadening the community and incentivizing project growth.

## Conclusion

ALAI Network's deflationary system is designed to encourage long-term token holding and community growth. Token retention becomes more rewarding through dividends, while the token price appreciates across presale stages. This balanced system of supply and demand makes ALAI an attractive choice for long-term investors and active participants in the project.
