At ALAI Network, we value every member of our community, and to reward the most active buyers, we’re launching a special contest with additional bonuses.

This contest gives you the opportunity to not only increase your share of ALAI tokens but also earn additional rewards for your purchases. Here are the details.

## Contest Overview
The contest aims to identify the top 30 wallets that make the largest ALAI token purchases during the event period.

If you make it to the leaderboard, you’ll receive generous bonuses:

- **1st place** — 300% bonus on the purchase amount.
- **2nd place** — 200% bonus on the purchase amount.
- **3rd place** — 100% bonus on the purchase amount.
- **4th–10th places** — 75% bonus on the purchase amount.
- **11th–20th places** — 50% bonus on the purchase amount.
- **21st–30th places** — 25% bonus on the purchase amount.

## How It Works
The leaderboard will be compiled once, at the end of the entire contest period. Make purchases, get on the top-30 buyers list, and receive your bonuses.

## Event Dates
The contest runs from **January 13, 2025, to January 20, 2025**. All ALAI token purchases made during this period will count.

## Why It’s Beneficial
The bonuses are funded through the buyback of tokens at market prices, which helps maintain the value of the trading pool and the stability of the ecosystem. Participating in this contest is not only a chance to earn extra rewards, but also a way to support the sustainable development of the project.

## How to Participate
Simply make ALAI token purchases during the contest period. All purchase data will automatically be counted when compiling the leaderboard.

Don’t miss the chance to increase your token holdings and earn valuable bonuses. Good luck in the contest!
