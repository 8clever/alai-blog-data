# Dividend System of ALAI Network: How It Works and Future Updates

## Current Functionality

At present, when you purchase ALAI tokens, the funds from your purchase are automatically directed to a trading pool managed by AI algorithms. These algorithms generate profit through trading operations involving the most relevant cryptocurrency pairs. The profit generated by the AI algorithms is allocated as follows:

- **50%** is used for dividend payouts to all system participants.
- **50%** is reinvested into the project’s development and the team.

Dividend payouts are automated—there is no need to claim them manually. On the 1st day of each month, participants receive their monthly payouts based on the amount of ALAI tokens they hold, which determines their share in the trading pool.

## During the Presale Phase

During the presale phase, the date of token purchase does not affect your eligibility for dividends. Even if you purchase tokens on the 30th of the month, you will receive your payout on the 1st of the following month, calculated according to the number of ALAI tokens you own.

## Post-Listing Functionality

### Key Changes After Listing on CEX

After the token is listed, new conditions will be introduced to qualify for dividend payouts:

1. **Token Storage**: Tokens must be stored in supported wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or other Web3 wallets).
2. **Holding Period**: Tokens must be held for a full calendar month.

It's important to note that dividends will only be distributed for the portion of tokens that meet the holding conditions. If you sell a portion of your ALAI tokens, dividends will only be calculated based on the remaining tokens that satisfy the holding requirement.

### New Profit Allocation Post-Listing

With the listing on **March 4, 2025**, a new profit distribution system will be implemented:

- **25%**: Dividends for participants who meet the holding conditions.
- **25%**: Allocated to the project team.
- **50%**: Reinvested into the trading pool.

This new allocation is essential for ensuring the sustainable growth of the AI-managed trading pool, which guarantees long-term income growth for participants.

### Monthly Trading Pool Increase Expectations

- **Expected Monthly Increase**: Ranging from **$360,000 to $1,100,000**.
- **By the End of 2025**:
  - With **5% reinvestments** to the pool: **$13,199,000**
  - With **10% reinvestments** to the pool: **$23,067,000**

Until the CEX listing, the current dividend ratio remains valid.

## Implementation Timeline

These updates will be launched simultaneously with the listing on CEX, scheduled for **March 4, 2025**.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve and enhance the ALAI ecosystem for our community.
