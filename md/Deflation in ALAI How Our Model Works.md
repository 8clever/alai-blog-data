# Deflation in ALAI: How Our Model Works

## How the Deflationary Model Works
At ALAI Network, we have implemented a deflationary model based on a limited token supply. A total of 21 million tokens will be issued, and there will be no more. This limitation creates scarcity, which contributes to the increase in token value over time.

The logic of our project revolves around providing users with the opportunity to earn passive income through the operation of our artificial intelligence system. This incentivizes users to hold onto their tokens, as the fewer tokens available in the market, the higher their value.

Currently, we are in the presale phase, and tokens are still available at a low price. This creates an opportunity for investors to acquire tokens in larger quantities before the price increases, potentially leading to significant appreciation in token value in the future.

## Examples of Deflationary Models
Deflationary models are actively utilized in various cryptocurrencies and projects. For instance, Bitcoin has a cap of 21 million coins, which creates scarcity. The gradually decreasing number of available Bitcoins due to mining leads to a constant increase in price.

Other examples include tokens that are burned after transactions, such as Binance Coin (BNB). When users pay fees in BNB, a portion of the tokens is burned, reducing the overall supply and consequently increasing their value.

Theoretically, a scarce asset creates demand, leading to an increase in its value as supply is limited. This principle has been demonstrated by many successful cryptocurrencies that have maintained consistent growth due to their deflationary models.

## Early Participation Opportunities
Out of the 21 million ALAI tokens, nearly 2 million are already held by early adopters. This leaves a large portion of tokens available for new investors eager to join during the early phase. By getting involved now, investors can secure a larger share in the system and reap the benefits as the network expands.

## Why ALAI Stands Out
- **Entry into a System**: ALAI token isn't just a coin—it's your entry into a powerful system.
- **Higher Share in Dividends**: The earlier you join, the bigger your share in the dividends.
- **Unique Pricing Mechanism**: ALAI’s token price isn't driven by market fluctuations but by the performance of our AI system. With a proven track record, the token will consistently attract demand, making it a stable and potentially profitable asset.
