# Why Now is the Best Time to Invest in ALAI Network

With just two days left until the next dividend payout, now is an optimal time to expand your holdings in ALAI Network at a highly favorable presale price. Early investors gain both increased monthly dividends and a potential for substantial growth in asset value when the token lists on DEX. Here’s why joining ALAI Network's presale stage right now is a powerful opportunity for those seeking both growth and passive income.

## The ALAI Network Presale: A Strategic Advantage for Early Investors

The presale phase is a critical time in any crypto project, and for ALAI Network, it opens the door to early token acquisition at favorable prices before exchange listing. Here are the key advantages of participating in this presale:

### Multi-Stage Structure for Maximum Potential

ALAI Network’s presale consists of 99 stages, each with its own token price, starting from $0.01 at Stage 1 and reaching $1 by Stage 99. This model incentivizes early investors to join as soon as possible, as each subsequent stage sees an incremental price increase.

### Consistent Price Growth Across Stages

Each stage sees a gradual price rise, positioning early investors for significant value gains. Currently, at Stage 23, tokens are available at $0.24, presenting an attractive entry price. Since the expected DEX listing price is $2 per token, those who join now can secure an excellent position for capital appreciation upon listing.

### Strategic Token Volume Allocation

ALAI Network’s total supply is limited to 21 million tokens, with 40% allocated to the presale, totaling 8.4 million tokens for early supporters. This structure caps token availability during the presale, offering early investors a larger share of ALAI’s overall token pool. With limited supply, this provides early adopters with significant potential in the project’s growth journey.

### Attractive Pricing at the Current Stage

Stage 23’s entry price of $0.24 makes this a prime time to join. With the listing price of $2 on the horizon, early participants stand to benefit from significant upside potential when the token becomes publicly tradable on the DEX.

### Early Entry Benefits with a Deflationary Model

The project’s tiered entry pricing supports a deflationary structure, rewarding early investors who can access the lowest prices while enhancing token value for future participants. The growing value at each stage offers sustained benefits for all token holders, from presale to public trading.

### Passive Income with ALAI Dividends

One of ALAI Network’s standout benefits is its dividend distribution model. Powered by AI-driven trading algorithms, a portion of ALAI’s trading profits is distributed monthly to token holders as dividends.

### Increased Monthly Dividend Share

The more tokens you own, the larger your share in the monthly dividends, making presale participation even more advantageous. Early investors in ALAI not only benefit from the potential price appreciation but also enjoy consistent passive income from dividends.

## In Summary:

ALAI Network’s presale is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire tokens at favorable rates before they are publicly traded. With a limited token supply, gradual price increases, and a DEX listing price set at $2, the presale offers early investors both capital appreciation and monthly dividends, making it an attractive choice for those looking to build long-term, growth-oriented wealth.
