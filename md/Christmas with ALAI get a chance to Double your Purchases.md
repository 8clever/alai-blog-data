# Christmas with ALAI: Get a Chance to Double Your Purchases

This Christmas is a time for special moments, and ALAI Network is here to make it unforgettable for our community. We’re launching a giveaway that not only brings joy to the winners but also strengthens the value of the ALAI token. Here are all the details, goals, and key dates for this exciting campaign.

## How Will the Giveaway Work?

### Participation Period
All purchases of ALAI tokens made between December 25 and January 1st (12 pm UTC) will automatically qualify for the Christmas campaign. There’s no need for additional registration or special actions—just purchase ALAI tokens during this period.

### Random Winner Selection
We will randomly select 25 purchases (based on BSC Scan transactions) using a dedicated randomizer program. The selection will take place live during our AMA session on January 3 at 15:00 UTC. Everything will be transparent and fair, so you can watch the entire process.

### Double Your Purchase
Winners will receive double the amount of their original purchase. For example, if you purchase 100 $ALAI, we will add another 100 $ALAI to your wallet.

### We Buy Tokens for You
The rewards for winners will come from tokens that we purchase. This is not just a giveaway; we are buying tokens to strengthen the ecosystem and provide additional support for all token holders. Meaning these double earned tokens will also contribute to the trading pool!

## Why Does This Matter for the Community and Ecosystem?
Typical giveaways are often seen as short-term campaigns that may increase activity temporarily but don’t always contribute to long-term project stability. We’ve chosen a different approach:

- **Building Trust**: A transparent winner selection process demonstrates our commitment to openness and fairness within the community.
- **Supporting Value**: By purchasing tokens for the rewards, we contribute to increased liquidity in the trading pool and token stability.
- **Encouraging Engagement**: This format motivates participation and creates additional opportunities for user involvement.

## Key Dates
- **Participation Period**: December 25 4 pm UTC to January 1st 12 pm UTC. Make purchases of ALAI tokens to automatically enter the giveaway.
- **AMA Session**: January 3 at 15:00 UTC. We will host a live session to select the winners using a randomizer program and answer your questions.

## How to Participate?
- Make purchases of ALAI tokens between December 25 and January 1st. Each purchase counts as a separate entry, so even a single transaction could make you a winner.
- Don’t miss your chance to be one of the 25 winners, double your purchase, and start the New Year with ALAI Network in a bright and inspiring way! See you at the AMA session on January 3.
