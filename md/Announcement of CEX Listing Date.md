# Announcement of CEX Listing Date!

Have you already seen the updated presale mechanism for ALAI Network? If not, make sure to check out our previous blog where we explained all the changes in detail!

Today, we have an important update for the entire community: we are excited to announce the exact date of the CEX listing, which became possible thanks to the new presale phase mechanism.

## Updated Presale Mechanism

With the new presale model, where each phase closes strictly on time instead of based on the number of tokens sold, we can now clearly announce when the 10th phase will end and when the CEX listing will take place. This allows us to provide a confirmed listing date and gives the community more certainty.

## CEX Listing Date

Here’s the important information:
- The 10th presale phase will end on **February 3, 2025**.
- After that, a 30-day final preparation period will begin. During this time, all necessary steps for the final preparations for the CEX listing will be completed.
- Therefore, the CEX listing date is **March 5, 2025**. This is the confirmed date you can rely on.

## Why Is This Important?

We know that many of you have been waiting for clear information regarding the presale’s completion and when the listing will happen. The new mechanism, with phases closing strictly by time, now allows us to plan the stages and gives you a clear understanding of when each phase will end.

With this update, you will be able to:
- Get a clear end date for the presale.
- Know when the CEX listing will happen.
- Easily navigate through the process.

## What’s New on the Website?

We’ve also updated our website, and now:
- You can see the time left until the next price increase and the start of the next phase.
- We’ve redesigned the purchase window, where all available methods to purchase ALAI are now displayed, making it easy for you to choose the right method.
- The interface is now more user-friendly and intuitive, improving your overall experience.

## What’s Next?

We’re confident that these updates will significantly improve your experience with ALAI Network. Keep an eye on our website for further updates and get ready for the exciting events that await us in the coming months. Join us and become part of the project before the presale ends and the successful CEX listing!
