As part of our strategic vision, ALAI Network has made the decision to bypass the DEX listing phase entirely and focus on a direct launch on centralized exchanges (CEX) upon the completion of the presale. This decision reflects our commitment to enhancing project stability, maximizing dividends for participants, and ensuring long-term success.

## Why the Focus on CEX?

The decision to forego a DEX listing is driven by the following considerations:

### Minimizing Dividend Dilution
Allocating tokens for a DEX liquidity pool would have diluted participant dividends significantly. For example:
- Initially, 2,100,000 ALAI were allocated for DEX, which could have diluted existing dividend shares by **70%**.
- This would have negatively impacted the returns for early supporters and hindered the overall growth of the project.

### Maximizing Stability

A direct launch on CEX eliminates the risks associated with DEX liquidity pools, such as:

- **Impermanent loss**

- **Fragmented trading volumes**

This ensures greater stability for the AI trading pool and dividend payouts.

## Updated Tokenomics

To strengthen the project’s foundation, we’ve restructured the token allocation to support a successful presale and direct CEX listing.

### New Tokenomics:

- **Public Presale:** 55% = 11,550,000 ALAI

- **Team:** 10% = 2,100,000 ALAI

- **Development:** 20% = 4,200,000 ALAI

- **Marketing:** 5% = 1,050,000 ALAI

- **CEX:** 10% = 2,100,000 ALAI

### Stronger Trading Pool
By reallocating tokens from the DEX liquidity pool to the presale, the project’s trading pool at launch will be significantly larger.

#### Projected Trading Pool Value at CEX Listing:

- **With previous tokenomics:** $4.2M

- **With updated tokenomics:** $7.35M (a ~16.3x increase from the current pool size of $452,000).

#### Compound Growth Table for $7.35M Trading Pool Over 12 Months
Below is a compound growth table showing three scenarios for the ALAI trading pool, starting with an initial value of $7.35M and growing monthly by 5%, 10%, and 15% over a 12-month period.

### Higher Dividends for Participants
The larger trading pool ensures a substantial increase in dividend payouts.

#### Projected Dividend Increase:

- **Previous tokenomics:** ~3x current dividends

- **Updated tokenomics:** ~4.5x current dividends

### Enhanced Market Trust
A direct launch on CEX demonstrates the project’s maturity and readiness for broader adoption, attracting institutional investors and larger trading volumes.
