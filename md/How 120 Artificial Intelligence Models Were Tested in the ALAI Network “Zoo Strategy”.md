# How 120 Artificial Intelligence Models Were Tested in the ALAI Network “Zoo Strategy”

In the world of artificial intelligence, each model is like a contestant in a big competition. But what happens when there aren’t just a few dozen, but over a hundred models? Welcome to the ALAI Network machine learning (ML) “Zoo Strategy” — a place where technologies undergo rigorous trials to prove their value.

## What Is the ALAI “Zoo Strategy”?
The “Zoo Strategy” isn’t about animals — it’s about diversity. It houses 120 unique ML models, each designed for different tasks like data analysis, market forecasting, text processing, and more. All these models work together as a unified system, but before they can contribute to the main flow, they must pass a strict selection process.

## How Were the Models Tested?
1. **Real-World Conditions**
   All models were tested under real market conditions. We intentionally avoided using the training data on which the models had been trained. This allowed us to see how they handle unpredictable scenarios.

2. **The Most Effective Models**
   Each model competed to prove its efficiency within the system. We evaluated them based on key parameters:
   - **Prediction accuracy** — How accurately does the model forecast market movements?
   - **Speed** — How quickly does it process data?
   - **Stability** — Does the model maintain high performance under stressful conditions?

3. **Daily Reports and Analysis**
   Every day, models were compared to one another. Their behavior was analyzed, hyperparameters were fine-tuned, and the most effective ones were identified and optimized.

## Why Is This Important?
The ALAI “Zoo Strategy” is more than just a testing ground. It’s a mechanism that ensures the perfect balance between innovation and practical application. This approach allows us to guarantee stable dividends and high prediction accuracy for our users.

## The Future of ALAI Technology
Every new model goes through this process. We continue to refine our “Zoo Strategy” and implement even more advanced algorithms. This ensures that ALAI Network remains at the forefront of AI and blockchain innovation.
