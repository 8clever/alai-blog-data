# BTC Predict as an Element of Transparency in the ALAI Network Ecosystem

ALAI Network is committed to providing tools that enhance user transparency and understanding of the platform's operations. One such tool is **BTC Predict** â€” a unique feature that allows users to observe the decision-making process of one of the ecosystem's machine learning (ML) models in real-time.

## What is BTC Predict?
BTC Predict is part of ALAI Network's "zoo of models," comprising over 120 ML models. This tool showcases how algorithms analyze market data and make trading decisions in real market conditions, offering users a transparent view of system operations.

It provides insights into how the models identify opportunities in the Bitcoin (BTC) market, including entry and exit points for trades.

## How Does BTC Predict Work?
In the ALAI Network console, a dedicated section for BTC Predict is available. Here, users can access a real-time chart that displays:
- Entry points for long positions.
- Entry points for short positions.

The chart is updated continuously, providing users with up-to-date market insights.

## Key Features to Note
Pay special attention to the latest active signal displayed on the chart:
- If the signal is closed by an opposite signal, this indicates the model has secured a profit and identified a change in the local trend.
- The latest signal may adjust before it is finalized. This happens because the model dynamically processes new data, which can lead to revised decisions.

BTC Predict relies on analyzing vast amounts of market data, making it a powerful tool. However, users should note that not all signals may materialize as predicted, and this possibility should be considered.

## User Opportunities
BTC Predict offers:
- A chance to observe the real-time operations of one of ALAI Network's ML models.
- Access to live market data and analysis.
- Insight into the methodologies of ALAI Network's "zoo of models."

This tool enhances users' understanding of the system's transparency and technical sophistication.

## Important to Remember
While you are free to use BTC Predict for market analysis or decision-making, please note that this tool is designed exclusively for familiarizing users with one of the 120 ML models in the ecosystem.
**All actions and trading decisions are entirely your responsibility.**

BTC Predict is a valuable tool for understanding how ALAI Network operates and for gaining a transparent view of how artificial intelligence makes decisions in real-market scenarios.
