# ALAI Network: Your Tool in the Fight Against Market Anomalies

Isolation Forest is a model used for anomaly detection in data. Imagine you have numerous data points representing information, such as stock or cryptocurrency prices. Anomalies are points that significantly differ from the rest, like unexpected spikes or drops in prices.

## How Isolation Forest Works in Simple Terms:

**Isolation of Points**: The model builds multiple "decision trees," where each data point is split based on random features. Anomalous points are easier to isolate because they are significantly different from others.

**Depth of Isolation**: Anomalies are typically isolated faster, meaning they reach the "leaves" of the tree earlier than normal data points. The quicker a point is isolated, the higher the likelihood that it is an anomaly.

**Outcome**: At the end of all the trees, the model determines how anomalous a data point is. The lower the "depth" of isolation, the greater the chance that the point is an anomaly.

## How Isolation Forest Integrates into ALAI Network to Enhance AI Trading:

ALAI Network utilizes Isolation Forest to detect anomalous market events, such as:
- **Unusual Price Spikes**: If the price of an asset changes drastically, the model identifies this and sends a signal for decision-making.
- **Anomalous Trading Volumes**: The model monitors trading volumes and identifies when unusual activity occurs, signaling possible manipulations or sudden shifts in market sentiment.
