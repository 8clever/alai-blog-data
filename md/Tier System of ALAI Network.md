ALAI Network offers a multi-level system that defines the conditions for participating in staking and the referral program. The tier level depends on the amount of $ALAI tokens in your balance. The $ALAI tokens are only an indicator of your level and do not participate in staking or payouts.

## Staking in ALAI Network
In ALAI Network, staking is done in USDT, and all payouts are also made exclusively in USDT.

By sending USDT to staking, you place your funds individually, separate from the trading pool, as your income in the staking system is individual, fixed, and guaranteed.

$ALAI tokens are needed only to determine your level (tier) and are not locked during the staking process. The staking conditions depend on your tier, which is determined by the amount of $ALAI on your balance:

- **Tier 1**:
  - Passive income: 2.5% for the entire period
  - Lockup period: 30 days
  - Min. $ALAI: 100

- **Tier 2**:
  - Passive income: 10% for the entire period
  - Lockup period: 90 days
  - Min. $ALAI: 1,000

- **Tier 3**:
  - Passive income: 27% for the entire period
  - Lockup period: 180 days
  - Min. $ALAI: 10,000

- **Tier 4**:
  - Passive income: 65.4% for the entire period
  - Lockup period: 360 days
  - Min. $ALAI: 100,000

## Referral Program
The referral program allows participants to earn bonuses by attracting new users.  
Payouts from the referral program are made in USDT.  
The bonus size depends on your level (tier), which is determined by the amount of $ALAI on your balance.

### Referral Program Conditions:
- **Default (Basic Level)**: 5%

- **Tier 1**: 8%

- **Tier 2**: 11%

- **Tier 3**: 14%

- **Tier 4**: 17.5%

### Example Calculation for Tier 2:
You lock 1,000 USDT for 90 days.  
After the period ends, you receive 10% income, which amounts to 1,100 USDT.  
Your referral bonus at this level is 11% of the income from referred users.  
$ALAI tokens allow you to maintain a high level in the system, but are not used in staking or payouts.

## Additional Products of the ALAI Ecosystem
The tier system for staking and the referral program are additional products within the ALAI ecosystem. By purchasing $ALAI tokens, you automatically become a participant in the dividend system and gain the opportunity to earn passive income through the project's profit distribution.
