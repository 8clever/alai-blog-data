The **ALAI Network** offers a powerful way for investors to generate **passive income** through **dividends** during the pre-sale phase. With an average monthly dividend of **6.2%**, your investment can grow substantially, especially when using the power of **compound interest**. In fact, by reinvesting your dividends, the effective annual return can reach an impressive **105.82%**, allowing your initial investment to more than double over the course of a year.

### What is Compound Interest?

**Compound interest** means earning interest not only on your initial investment but also on any dividends or returns you’ve already received. In the ALAI pre-sale, by reinvesting your monthly dividends, you’re taking advantage of **compounding**, which exponentially increases your earnings over time.

For example, with a **6.2% monthly return**, by reinvesting your earnings, your total annual return with compound interest will amount to approximately **105.82%**. This means your investment can more than double in a year simply by allowing your dividends to compound each month.
