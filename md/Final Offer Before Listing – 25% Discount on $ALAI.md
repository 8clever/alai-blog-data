We are launching the final promotion before ALAI's listing on Bybit, giving every ALAI Network participant the chance to buy tokens at a 25% discount.

From **February 10 to February 15**, you will be able to purchase ALAI at the reduced price of **$0.61** before the start of partner sales. After this promotion ends, token purchases will only be available at market prices.

## Why are we launching this promotion?

Over the past weekend, the ALAI Network team held key negotiations with partners. As a result, the start of partner sales has been scheduled for **February 16, 2025**, with a fixed token price of **$0.61**. This is approximately **25% lower** than the current price.

We are committed to transparency and equal opportunities for all members of our community. Therefore, we are offering the same discount to ALAI Network participants before the partner sales phase begins.

This is the **last chance** to buy ALAI at a reduced price before the listing, and we encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity.
