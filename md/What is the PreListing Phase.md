# What is the PreListing Phase?

The PreListing Phase is a strategic stage in ALAI Network, primarily intended for partners but also available to the community. It provides the opportunity to purchase ALAI tokens at a stable price of $0.81, ensuring fair and transparent purchases for all participants until the official listing.

## Why is the PreListing Phase Starting Now?

The decision to start the PreListing Phase was made because the price of ALAI has reached its maximum point at $0.81. This stage serves as an indicator of the project's growth and the trust built through previous presale stages. Here's why this phase is crucial:

### 1. Partner Attraction and Market Stability

- **Attracting Partners**: A stable price and successful presale stages demonstrate the system's stability, the team's reliability, and the strength of the community, making the project attractive to strategic partners.

- **Increased Trading Liquidity**: Purchases by partners contribute to the increase of the trading pool, which is a key element of the dividend system, ensuring a stronger market at the time of listing.

- **Fair Distribution**: The balanced distribution of tokens at the current price ensures equal access to ALAI and reduces price volatility post-listing.

### 2. Benefits for the Community

Although the PreListing Phase is primarily designed for partners, it is open to the community as well. This approach serves both as a reward and a guarantee that all purchases will occur under equal conditions.

- **Full Transparency**: Each transaction and the expansion of the trading pool can be tracked in real-time, promoting trust and transparency.

- **Equal Terms**: Community members can purchase ALAI on the same terms as partners, ensuring fair participation.

## How Long Will the PreListing Phase Last?

The PreListing Phase will run until the official listing on March 4. This period allows for continued market preparation, ecosystem expansion, and liquidity growth, laying the foundation for a successful launch.

By purchasing ALAI at this stage, participants gain the opportunity to get ahead of the listing, benefiting from early access to the token in an environment of stability and transparency.
