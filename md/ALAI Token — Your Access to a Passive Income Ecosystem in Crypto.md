## Dividend System

When ALAI tokens are purchased, the funds go into a trading pool managed by AI. Throughout the month, the AI generates profits, and 50% of these profits are distributed among ALAI token holders proportionally to their holdings. Payments are made monthly in USDT, ensuring income stability.

To receive dividends, holders must keep their ALAI tokens in their wallets for at least 30 days, supporting the project’s long-term stability and reducing token sell-offs.
