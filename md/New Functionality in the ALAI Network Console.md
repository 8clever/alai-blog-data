Exciting news! The BTC Price Prediction Page is now available in the ALAI Network console.
We’ve introduced a feature that displays, in real time, the performance of one of the 120 AI models used by ALAI Network.

## How It Works

The page features a live graph that provides signals in real time. You’ll see:

- **Green arrows pointing up**: Indicating long positions.

- **Red arrows pointing down**: Indicating short positions.

This is a direct visualization of one AI model’s predictions. While this is only one model from ALAI Network's comprehensive "model zoo," it gives you a glimpse into how our AI operates.

## Can You Use It for Trading?

We have no objection to our users utilizing this information for their own purposes. However, please note that all trading decisions are made at your own risk. This tool is designed to enhance transparency and provide insights, not to offer guaranteed results.

## Why Did We Create This?

The BTC Prediction Page was developed to offer you a deeper understanding of how our model zoo functions. Think of it as an internal statistical snapshot—a way to see ALAI Network's AI system at work.

This is just one more step toward our commitment to making the system as transparent as possible for our users. **Explore the page in your console today!**
